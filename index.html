<h2>The poem:</h2>
<pre>
Did you hear about the rose that - 
grew from a crack in the concrete?
Proving nature's law is wrong it.
learned to walk with out having feet.
Funny it seems, but by keeping it's dreams,
it learned to breathe fresh air.
Long live the rose that grew from concrete - 
when no one else ever cared.
</pre>
 <h2>Analysis:</h2>
    <pre>
    The author had a difficult life and he overcame many challenges in his life, so the rose refers to the author himself.
    However, the rose also is a symbol of people who have ever faced difficulties that seemed can not be solved in lives and overcame them.
    The <i>poor law</i> is not working if people keep their dreams.
