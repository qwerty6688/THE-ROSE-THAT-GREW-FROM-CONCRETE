<h2>The poem:</h2>
<p>So I took the seed
I guess it was all that I would need
The Once-ler told me, 'Go. Go and spread the word.'
'Let it be done and let it be heard.'
So I ran back into town and didn't want to let the Once-ler down.
So I told everyone, 'Hey, we need to plant this seed in the middle of town.'
Everyone was confused at first until I explained,
So then we planted the seed without being abstained.
I grabbed some water and poured it over the seed,
And as everyone watched the Truffula Tree started to increase.
From his factory I guess the Once-ler could see it all,
Because I saw the wood on his window begin to spall.
After he made it to town he looked at the tree and cried,
The Once-ler repeated and repeated that he was sorry that the tree had died.
I told him it wasn't your fault, you didn't know any better,
But he just cried and cried on and his shirt just got wetter.
So days passed by and everyone started to get Truffula trees,
And people were very pleased.
So everything was better than what happened in the beginning,
And now there's nothing more to say than this is the ending.</p>
