<h2>The poem:</h2>
    <p id="PoemButton" class="hvr-float">Show/Hide the poem</p>
<p class="detail" id="Poem">
Did you hear about the rose that - <br>
grew from a crack in the concrete?<br>
Proving nature's law is wrong it.<br>
learned to walk with out having feet.<br>
Funny it seems, but by keeping it's dreams,<br>
it learned to breathe fresh air.<br>
Long live the rose that grew from concrete - <br>
when no one else ever cared.<br>
</p>
 <h2>Analysis:</h2>
    <p id="AnalysisButton" class="hvr-float">Show/Hide the analysis</p>
    <p class="detail" id="Analysis">
    The author had a difficult life and he overcame many challenges in his life, so the rose refers to the author himself.<br>
    However, the rose also is a symbol of people who have ever faced difficulties that seemed can not be solved in lives and overcame them.<br>
    The <i>poor people's regular pattern</i> is not working if people keep their dreams.<br>
    <i>no one else ever cared</i> shows that people do not care about what kind of difficulties people experienced, they can only see their achievement.<br>
